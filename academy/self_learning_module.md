# InkyPi Academy — Self-Learning Module Template

Use this module inside any mission to build reading, explaining, and debugging habits.
It is designed to be auto-validated with lightweight checks.

---

## Required Files (per mission)
Create these in the mission folder:
- `explain.md`
- `predict.md`
- `trace.md`
- `bad_code.py`
- `bad_code_explain.md`
- `copilot_input.txt` (auto-generated by `check.py`)

---

## explain.md (Explain-Back Prompts)
Learner writes 2–4 sentences per prompt.

Prompts:
1) In one sentence, explain what this file does overall.
2) Explain what `Image.new(...)` does and what each parameter means.
3) Explain why we use a loop here instead of repeating code.
4) Explain one line that confused you, in your own words.

---

## bad_code.py + bad_code_explain.md (Fix + Explain)
Provide a short “bad code” snippet inside the mission and ask the learner to:
1) Fix it.
2) Explain why the fix is better.
3) Say when the “bad” approach might still be acceptable.

**Preferred files**
- `bad_code.py` (runnable, with a tiny FakeDraw preview)
- `bad_code_explain.md` (reflection answers)

This can be auto-validated by checking that the files exist and have a minimum length.

---

## predict.md (Predict Before Running)
Learner writes a prediction before running the code.

Prompts:
1) If `box_count = 4`, how many boxes appear and where?
2) If `padding` increases, what changes on the screen?

---

## trace.md (Trace a Small Example)
Learner traces a simple example.

Prompts:
1) If `w=200`, `h=100`, `padding=10`, `gap=10`, and `box_count=3`,
   what is the `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` for the first box?
2) What is the `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` for the second box?

---

## copilot_input.txt (Copilot As Grader)
This file is generated by `check.py` and contains a ready-to-paste prompt.

```
You are a strict grader. Do not give the correct answer.
Evaluate my explanation using this rubric:
- Mentions function name and purpose
- Mentions parameters and their meaning
- Describes what changes on the screen
- Uses plain language suitable for a 12-year-old
Score each item 0-2 and explain what is missing.

Here is my explanation:
[PASTE EXPLANATION HERE]
```

**Copilot follow-up prompts (coach mode)**
- “Ask me to explain this code using a kitchen analogy.”
- “Show a bad example and ask me to refactor it.”
- “Ask me when I should and should not use this concept.”

---

## Auto-Validation Ideas (check_explain.py)
The mission check script can verify the learner wrote the files:
- File exists
- Minimum length (e.g., 200 characters)
- Required keywords (e.g., `Image.new`, `loop`, `parameter`)
- All prompts answered (detect headings or numbered answers)

Example check logic (pseudocode):
```
assert explain.md exists
assert len(explain.md) >= 200
assert "Image.new" in explain.md
assert "loop" in explain.md
assert bad_code.py exists
assert len(bad_code.py) >= 120
assert bad_code_explain.md exists
assert len(bad_code_explain.md) >= 80
```

This does not judge correctness, but it enforces practice and reflection.

---

## Copilot Workflow (Run → Open → Paste → Continue)
1) Run `python3 check.py` to generate `copilot_input.txt`.
2) Open `copilot_input.txt` and copy all.
3) Start a **new Copilot Chat** titled with the mission (e.g., `C-01 Explain-Back`).
4) Paste the content and send.
5) If Copilot says you missed something, keep chatting until you fix your answer.
6) Update `explain.md` and re-run `python3 check.py` to re-validate.
