# NOTE: Briefing Structure Updated

**See PEDAGOGICAL_UPDATES.md for complete details**

The briefing structure has been enhanced to focus on problem-driven teaching:

## Old Structure (Syntax Cards)
- Hook
- Definition  
- Syntax snippet
- Common mistakes
- Where used

## New Structure (Problem → Solution → Deep Dive)

### Part 1: The Problem Story
Show messy code without the concept. Make the pain visceral.

### Part 2: The Solution
Introduce concept with powerful analogies. Show dramatic improvement.

### Part 3: Breaking It Down
For each sub-concept:
- Hook (metaphor)
- Definition
- **Before/After Code Example** ← CRITICAL NEW ADDITION
- Common mistakes
- Where used
- **Scalability context** ← NEW ("When you have 50 items...", "When working with a team...")

**Key Principle**: Every concept needs a side-by-side comparison showing the pain of NOT using it.

See `academy/mission_template.md` section 4 for the complete template.
