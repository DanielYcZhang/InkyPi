# Explain-Back (C-03)

1) In one sentence, explain what this file does overall.

2) Pick one line from `c03_inheritance_practice.py` and explain it in your own words.

3) Concept checkpoints:
   - Explain why `PetCard` is a subclass of `BaseCard`.
   - Explain what `super()` does in this mission.
   - Explain what extra part the subclass adds.

4) Reflection: When would inheritance be a bad idea?
