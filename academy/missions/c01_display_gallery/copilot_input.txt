You are a strict grader. Do not give the correct answer.
Evaluate my explanation using this rubric:
- Mentions function name and purpose
- Mentions parameters and their meaning
- Describes what changes on the screen
- Uses plain language suitable for a 12-year-old

Score each item 0-2 and explain what is missing.

Here is my explanation:
# Explain-Back (C-01)

1. In one sentence, explain what this file does overall.
   this file asks me questions to test my knowledge on what i've learnt so far.

2. Pick one line from `c01_display_gallery.py` and explain it in your own words.
   box*width = (w - padding * 2 - gap \_ (box_count - 1)) // box_count
   this line's goal is to figure out how big the width of the box should be depending on other variables. it figues out how big the width of the box should be by first finding the width of the whole screen/canvas and taking away the padding space on both sides, then it gets the gap size and number of boxes and takes away one from that number to figure out the number of gaps between the boxes.

3. Concept checkpoints:

   - Explain why `padding` is a variable instead of a one-off number.
     It is a varibale because if you wanted the same amount of padding everywhere and you put a bunch of padding on your canvas, but then you decided there was too much padding, you could just change the padding variable instead of changing all the padding which will take much longer, its also easier to understand.
   - Explain what `(x, y)` means on the screen.
     x,y are coordinates since the screen is a graph so x is how much you move horizontally and y is how much you vertically. 0,0 would be top left of screen.
   - Explain what parameters `Image.new(...)` expects and why.
     it creates a blank canvas for you to draw on. it needs three things which are:
     mode, this tells the computer what type of screen you have for example black and white. size, this tells the computer the width and height of your screen.
     colour, this tells the computer what colour the background should be, normall it is 255(white).
   - Explain why we use `w` and `h` instead of hard-coding numbers.
     we use w and h instead of hard coding numbers because if one day you switch to a smaller screen, the stuff will be drawn of the edge. so we use w, h and get resolution so the code asks the device how big the screen is and adjusts the layout.
   - Explain why a loop is used to draw multiple boxes.
     we use a loop because it is easier since most of the time you want boxes of the same size that are aligned nicely, so if we use a loop to make them the code looks cleaner and its harder to mess up.

4. Reflection: What would you refactor if you had 10 more minutes?
   this question is bad
