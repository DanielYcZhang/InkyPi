# Explain-Back (C-01)

1) In one sentence, explain what this file does overall.

2) Pick one line from `c01_display_gallery.py` and explain it in your own words.

3) Concept checkpoints:
   - Explain why `padding` is a variable instead of a one-off number.
   - Explain what `(x, y)` means on the screen.
   - Explain what parameters `Image.new(...)` expects and why.
   - Explain why we use `w` and `h` instead of hard-coding numbers.
   - Explain why a loop is used to draw multiple boxes.

4) Reflection: What would you refactor if you had 10 more minutes?
