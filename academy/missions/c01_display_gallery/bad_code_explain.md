# Bad vs Good (C-01) — Explanation

1. Why is your version better?
   my version is better because it uses variables and loops which make the code shorter and easier to understand. My code isn't hardcoded as well so if you can just change a couple variables instead of changing a bunch of things in all the code.

2. When might the bad version be acceptable?
   When there is only one box or a small amount of things you need to make since it is faster.
