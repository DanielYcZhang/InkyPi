# Bad vs Good (C-02) — Explanation

1. Why is your version better?
   my version is better because it uses a class and has properties and the draw method with makes the code easier to read and reusable. each creature object can draw and the pixel space isn't hard coded

2. When might the bad version be acceptable?
   when there is only one box or a small amount of things you need to make since it is faster.

these questsions are the same as last time so a bit repetitive since the bad_code always has the same goal
